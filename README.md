# 🛡️ SOC Analyst Playbook

Author: **Joshua Sigley**
Target Role: **SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Analyst / Security Operations**

---

# 🔎 Overview

This repository demonstrates **Security Operations Center (SOC) investigation workflows** using real-world tools and methodologies.

The project simulates how SOC analysts investigate and document security incidents including:

• Phishing attacks
• Malware execution
• Suspicious network traffic
• Threat intelligence correlation

Each investigation follows a **structured incident response process aligned with MITRE ATT&CK** and standard SOC operating procedures.

# 🧰 Tools Used

• ANY.RUN
• Hybrid Analysis
• MetaDefender
• VirusTotal
• Wireshark
• TryHackMe
• MITRE ATT&CK Framework
• Markdown Documentation

# 🧠 SOC Investigation Workflow

The investigations follow a repeatable SOC analysis methodology:

### Phase 1 — Initial Alert / Email Recon

* Review sender domain
* Inspect suspicious links
* Identify phishing tactics
* Capture email artifacts

### Phase 2 — Sandbox Analysis

* Execute files or URLs inside sandbox
* Observe process behavior
* Identify dropped files
* Monitor network connections

### Phase 3 — Threat Intelligence

* Submit hashes and URLs to:

  * VirusTotal
  * MetaDefender
  * Hybrid Analysis
* Record detection ratios and reputation

### Phase 4 — MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Example techniques observed:

| Technique | Description        |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| T1566.001 | Phishing via Email |
| T1204.002 | User Execution     |
| T1059     | Command Execution  |
| T1111     | Credential Access  |

## 🛠️ SIEM Simulation & Lookup Tables
The files in this repository are designed to be used in a live SOC environment (Wazuh/Splunk).

* **`incident_tracker.csv`**: A high-level management log of all investigations, outcomes, and MITRE mappings.
* **`ioc_tracker.csv`**: A technical lookup table intended for SIEM automation. 
    * **Usage**: Import this as a **Lookup Table** in Splunk or a **CDB List** in Wazuh.
    * **Automation**: Use this file to automatically tag or block traffic matching known malicious IPs, Hashes, or URLs.
